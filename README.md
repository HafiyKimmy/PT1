# Programming Technique 1

This course introduces students to problem-solving techniques using a structured programming approach in C++. It covers basic concepts such as variables, data types, input and output, control structures (sequence, selection, and loops), functions, arrays, file handling, pointers, and structured data types. Through lectures, lab work, and assignments, students learn to write C++ programs to solve simple to moderate problems. By the end of the course, students will be able to analyze problems systematically and develop efficient C++ programs within a given time.
